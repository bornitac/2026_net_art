    This is the lyrics to my current favorite song:
    <br>
Im staring at your shrinking face, dont cry <br>
You know my heart belongs to you <br>
One last time, say that you want me too <br>
The only words that gave me life <br>
Now Ill see you on the other side...<br>
Its a threat, not a promise (mmm) <br>
If youre looking for&nbsp;rage (mmm, oh)<br>
If youre looking for ragin'
